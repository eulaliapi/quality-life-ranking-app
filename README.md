# Quality Life App

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.3.6.

## Description

Using [Teleport's APIs](https://developers.teleport.org/api/getting_started/) the application will retrive some information about a particular location typed in the search bar.</br> The app will show a short description of the city and the general score of the city based on Teleport's users opinion. Moreover the user will be able to visualize the score for each category created by Teleport. 

At the start of the application, the user will be able to type the name of a city. If the city doesn't return any result, a message asking for another city will appear, on the contrary a list with the cities that match the query will be visible to the user. If clicked, each of these cities will lead to a details page.
